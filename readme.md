# HTTP Web Server for Windows

This is a little toy project in C++17 that may evolve over time.
Currently there's too many obvious TODOs to even list them all.

Key points:
- Windows Socket API
- Synchronous thread per connection
- Dynamic URLs
- Query parameters
- Server side templating, inspired by Handlebars
